abstract = {This paper presents a behavior-based adaptive mission planner (AMP)to trace a chemical plume to its source and reliably declare the source location. The proposed AMP is implemented on a REMUS autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV)equipped with multiple types of sensors that measure chemical concentration,the flow velocity vector, and AUV position, depth, altitude, attitude, and speed. This paper describes the methods and results from experiments conducted in November 2002 on San Clemente Island, CA, using a plume of Rhodamine dye developed in a turbulent fluid flow (i.e., near-shore ocean conditions). These experiments demonstrated chemical plume tracing over 100 m and source declaration accuracy relative to the nominal source location on the order of tens of meters. The designed maneuvers are divided into four behavior types: finding a plume,tracing the plume, reacquiring the plume, and declaring the source location. The tracing and reacquiring behaviors are inspired by male moths flying up wind along a pheromone plume to locate a sexually receptive female. All behaviors are formulated by perception and action modules and translated into chemical plume-tracing algorithms suitable for implementation on a REMUS AUV. To coordinate the different behaviors, the subsumption architecture is adopted to define and arbitrate the behavior priorities. AUVs capable of such feats would have applicability in searching for environmentally interesting phenomena, unexploded ordnance, undersea wreckage, and sources of hazardous chemicals or pollutants.},

abstract = {Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) have a wide range of applications in marine geoscience, and are increasingly being used in the scientific, military, commercial, and policy sectors. Their ability to operate autonomously of a host vessel makes them well suited to exploration of extreme environments, from the world's deepest hydrothermal vents to beneath polar ice sheets. They have revolutionised our ability to image the seafloor, providing higher resolution seafloor mapping data than can be achieved from surface vessels, particularly in deep water. This contribution focuses on the major advances in marine geoscience that have resulted from AUV data. The primary applications are i) submarine volcanism and hydrothermal vent studies, ii) mapping and monitoring of low-temperature fluid escape features and chemosynthetic ecosystems, iii) benthic habitat mapping in shallow- and deep-water environments, and iv) mapping of seafloor morphological features (e.g. bedforms generated beneath ice or sediment-gravity flows). A series of new datasets is presented that highlight the growing versatility of AUVs for marine geoscience studies, including i) multi-frequency acoustic imaging of trawling impacts on deep-water coral mounds, iii) collection of high-resolution seafloor photomosaics at abyssal depths, and iii) velocity measurements of active submarine density flows. Future developments in AUV technology of potential relevance to marine geoscience include new vehicles with enhanced hovering, long endurance, extreme depth, or rapid response capabilities, while development of new sensors will further expand the range of geochemical parameters that can be measured. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

abstract = {To make progress in understanding the distribution and genesis of coral mounds in cold and dark water, maps of morphol ogy and oceanographi c condi t i ons resol vi ng features at the 1 – 10 m scale are needed. An autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) cruising 40 m above the seafloor surveyed a 48 km2 coral mound field in 600 – 800 m water depth at the base of slope of Great Bahama Bank. The AUV acquired 1 – 3 meter resolution acoustic backscatter and bathymetry together with current vectors, salinity, and temperature. The multibeam bathymetry resolved more than 200 coral mounds reaching up to 90 m height. Mound morphology is surprisingly diverse and mound distribution follows E-W oriented off-bank ridges. Bottom currents reverse every 6 hours indicating tidal flow decoupled from the north flowing surface current. The AUV data fill the gap between low-resolution surface-based mapping and visual observations on the seafloor, revealing the dynamic environment and spatial relationships of an entire coral mound field.mound morphology, distribution and extent of coral mound fields. Similarly the oceanographic time series are too short to assess diurnal changes. [3] This paper demonstrates how modern multibeam mapping, backscatter classification and sensor deployment from an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) open a window of opportunity to fill in the scale gap of basic information on deep-water ecosystems. We used a surface deployed multibeam system to detect mound features larger than 20m demarcating a field of mounds. The AUV then acoustically mapped the entire field of 48 km2 at high resolution in one dive over a period of 45 hrs and contin- uously recorded bottom currents, temperature and salinity. The AUV technology reveals the oceanographic environ- ment, the morphology of the mounds and their spatial distribution in unprecedented detail. Most importantly, these new data question some of the existing paradigms for the evolution of deep water coral reefs.},

The work is motivated by planning domains involving nontrivial dynamics, spatially varying measurement properties, and obstacle constraints. To make the problem tractable, we restrict the motion plan to a nominal trajectory stabilized with a linear estimator and controller. This allows us to predict distributions over future states given a candidate nominal trajectory. Using these distributions to ensure a bounded probability of collision, the algorithm incrementally constructs a graph of trajectories through state space, while efficiently searching over candidate paths through the graph at each iteration. This process results in a search tree in belief space that provably converges to the optimal path. We analyze the algorithm theoretically and also provide simulation results demonstrating its utility for balancing information gathering to reduce uncertainty and finding low cost paths.},

abstract = {Roadmap spanners provide a way to acquire sparse data structures that efficiently answer motion planning queries with probabilistic completeness and asymptotic near-optimality. The current SPARS method provides these properties by building two graphs in parallel: a dense asymptotically-optimal roadmap based on PRM* and its spanner. This paper shows that it is possible to relax the conditions under which a sample is added to the spanner and provide guarantees, while not requiring the use of a dense graph. A key aspect of SPARS is that the probability of adding nodes to the roadmap goes to zero as iterations increase, which is maintained in the proposed extension. The paper describes the new algorithm, argues its theoretical properties and evaluates it against PRM* and the original SPARS algorithm. The experimental results show that the memory requirements of the method upon construction are dramatically reduced, while returning competitive quality paths with PRM*. There is a small sacrifice in the size of the final spanner relative to SPARS but the new method still returns graphs orders of magnitudes smaller than PRM*, leading to very efficient online query resolution.},

This paper presents a novel real-time planning algorithm, chance con- strained rapidly-exploring random trees (CC-RRT), which uses chance constraints to guarantee probabilistic feasibility for linear systems subject to process noise and/or uncertain, possibly dynamic obstacles. By using RRT, the algorithm enjoys the computational benefits of sampling-based algorithms, such as trajectory-wise constraint checking and incorporation of heuristics, while explicitly incorporating uncertainty within the formulation. Under the assumption of Gaussian noise, prob- abilistic feasibility at each time step can be established through simple simulation of the state conditional mean and the evaluation of linear constraints. Alternatively, a small amount of additional computation can be used to explicitly compute a less conservative probability bound at each time step. Simulation results show that this algorithm can be used for efficient identification and execution of probabilistically safe paths in real time.},

The icLQG algorithm uses the belief roadmap algorithm to efficiently search for a trajectory that approximates the globally-optimal motion plan in information space, and then iteratively computes a feedback control law to locally optimize the global approximation. The icLQG algorithm is not only robust to imperfect state information but also scalable to high-dimensional systems and environments. In addition, icLQG is capable of answering multiple queries efficiently. We demonstrate performance results for controlling a vehicle on the plane and a helicopter in three dimensions.},

This enables the planner to identify configuration space paths that minimize uncertainty and, when necessary, efficiently pursue further exploration through utility-guided sensing of the workspace. Experimental results indicate that our utility-guided approach results in a robust planner even in the presence of significant error in its perception of the workspace.

Alvarez and Caiti used dynamic programming to find the optimal path in terms of energy savings for AUVs while considering the spatial current velocity field. They investigated the relationship between the spatial scales of the current field variability and the expected energy savings.

A significant consideration in start-to-goal path planning in an underwater environment is accounting for ocean or estuarine currents.

Finally, the problem of AUV mission planning optimizing the energy cost in ocean environments with real current fields was considered by Alvarez et al. [10]. The developed planning algorithm integrated the current predictions obtained from the Harvard Ocean Prediction System (HOPS) [11] to an evolutionary navigator, providing the path with minimum energy requirements. In these studies incorporating the current field, the AUV speed with respect to the bottom was assumed to be constant. Thus, the considered AUV was able to adapt its speed depending on the current field where it was immersed, being the total speed

In [Kruger 2006]
Alvarez et al., [10], do address variable current speeds in a 3D environment, using genetic algorithms to find an optimal path while avoiding convergence on local cost minima. The approach also involves partitioning the search space into a relatively coarse grid of cells and then searching a space of possible paths which link these cells. 3D currents are simplified to representations as a small number of discreet 2D layers. The current speeds encountered are relatively small (maximum 0.65ms-1) compared to those addressed in this paper and the currents are approximately locally constant (varying over tens or hundreds of km) in contrast to those addressed in this paper which vary significantly over distances of a few meters.},

The approach is motivated by the motion planning problem for autonomous vehicles navigating in GPS-denied dynamic environments, which involves non-linear and/or non-holonomic vehicle dynamics, incomplete state estimates, and constraints imposed by uncertain and cluttered environments. To address the above motion planning problem, we propose an extension of the closed-loop rapid belief trees, the closed-loop random belief trees (CL-RBT), which incorporates predictions of the position estimation uncertainty, using a factored form of the covariance provided by the Kalman filter-based estimator. The proposed motion planner operates by incrementally constructing a tree of dynamically feasible trajectories using the closed-loop prediction, while selecting candidate paths with low uncertainty using efficient covariance update and propagation. The algorithm can operate in real-time, continuously providing the controller with feasible paths for execution, enabling the vehicle to account for dynamic and uncertain environments. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach can generate feasible trajectories that reduce the state estimation uncertainty, while handling complex vehicle dynamics and environment constraints.},

abstract = {We present a framework for analyzing and computing motion plans for a robot that operates in an environment that both varies over time and is not completely predictable. We first classify sources of uncertainty in motion planning into four categories, and argue that the problems addressed in this paper belong to a fundamental category that has received little attention. We treat the changing environment in a flexible manner by combining traditional configuration space concepts with a Markov process that models the environment. For this context, we then propose the use of a motion strategy, which provides a motion command for the robot for each contingency that it could be confronted with. We allow the specification of a desired performance criterion, such as time or distance, and determine a motion strategy that is optimal with respect to that criterion. We demonstrate the breadth of our framework by applying it to a variety of motion planning problems. Examples are computed...},

abstract = {One approach to designing an optimal real-time collision-free trajectory for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) that move in a 3D unknown underwater space presented here. By explicitly considering the kinematic model of AUVs, a class of feasible trajectories is derived in a closed form, and is expressed in terms of two adjustable parameters for the purpose of collision avoidance. Then, a collision avoidance condition is developed to determine a class of collision-free trajectories. Finally, a performance index is established to find an optimal trajectory from the class. All the steps can be implemented in real-time. The advantages of the proposed approach are: (1) The 3D motion planning problem is reduced to a 2D problem. Instead of directly searching in a 3D space, one only needs to determine two parameters in their plane. Therefore computational efforts are greatly reduced, which is suitable for real-time implementation; (2) The vehicle's kinematic model is explicitly considered, and all boundary conditions are met. After the parameters are determined, the trajectory and controls are explicitly solved in closed forms. This method is shown to be effective by computer simulations.},

abstract = {Inherent safety is a proactive approach for hazard/risk management during process plant design and operation. It has been proven that, considering the lifetime costs of a process and its operation, an inherently safer approach is a cost-optimal option. Inherent safety can be incorporated at any stage of design and operation; however, its application at the earliest possible stages of process design (such as process selection and conceptual design) yields the best results. Although it is an attractive and cost-effective approach to hazard/risk management, inherent safety has not been used as widely as other techniques such as HAZOP and quantitative risk assessment. There are many reasons responsible for this; key among them are a lack of awareness and the non-availability of a systematic methodology and tools. The inherent safety approach is the best option for hazard/risk management in offshore oil and gas activities. In the past, it has been applied to several aspects of offshore process design and operation. However, its use is still limited. This article attempts to present a complete picture of inherent safety application in offshore oil and gas activities. It discuses the use of available technology for implementation of inherent safety principles in various offshore activities, both current and planned for the future. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

In order to do so, the authors propose a method, called Ariadne's clew algorithm, to build a global path planner based on the combination of two local planning algorithms: an explore algorithm and a search algorithm. The purpose of the explore algorithm is to collect information about the environment with an increasingly fine resolution by placing landmarks in the searched space. The goal of the search algorithm is to opportunistically check if the target can be easily reached from any given placed landmark. The Ariadne's clew algorithm is shown to be very fast is most cases, allowing planning in dynamic environment. It is shown to be complete, which means that it is sure to find a path when one exists. A massively parallel implementation of this algorithm is described.},

This enables us to use LQG control to guide the needle along the path. For a given path and sensor placement, we show that a priori probability distributions of the needle state can be estimated in advance. Our approach then plans a set of candidate paths and sensor placements and selects the pair for which the estimated uncertainty is least likely to cause intersections with obstacles.

Genetic optimization is used to search for a collision-free path from one of the landmarks to a point as far as possible from all previous landmarks. The planner places a new landmark at this point, and searches for a path to the goal configuration. New land- marks are placed until the goal configuration can be connected [Bohlin00]},

abstract = {This paper considers finite-horizon optimal control for dynamic systems subject to additive Gaussian-distributed stochastic disturbance and a chance constraint on the system state defined on a non-convex feasible space. The chance constraint requires that the probability of constraint violation is below a user-specified risk bound. A great deal of recent work has studied joint chance constraints, which are defined on the a conjunction of linear state constraints. These constraints can handle convex feasible regions, but do not extend readily to problems with non-convex state spaces, such as path planning with obstacles. In this paper we extend our prior work on chance constrained control in non-convex feasible regions to develop a new algorithm that solves the chance constrained control problem with very little conservatism compared to prior approaches. In order to address the non-convex chance constrained optimization problem, we present two innovative ideas in this paper. First, we develop a new bounding method to obtain a set of decomposed chance constraints that is a sufficient condition of the original chance constraint. The decomposition of the chance constraint enables its efficient evaluation, as well as the application of the branch and bound method. However, the slow computation of the branch and bound algorithm prevents practical applications. This issue is addressed by our second innovation called Fixed Risk Relaxation (FRR), which efficiently gives a tight lower bound to the convex chance-constrained optimization problem. Our empirical results show that the FRR typically makes branch and bound algorithm 10-20 times faster. In addition we show that the new algorithm is significantly less conservative than the existing approach.},

abstract = {Agents operating in the real world often have limited time available for planning their next actions. Producing optimal plans is infeasible in these scenarios. Instead, agents must be satisfied with the best plans they can generate within the time available. One class of planners well-suited to this task are anytime planners, which quickly find an initial, highly suboptimal plan, and then improve this plan until time runs out. A second challenge associated with planning in the real world is that models are usually imperfect and environments are often dynamic. Thus, agents need to update their models and consequently plans over time. Incremental planners, which make use of the results of previous planning efforts to generate a new plan, can substantially speed up each planning episode in such cases. In this paper, we present an A*-based anytime search algorithm that produces significantly better solutions than current approaches, while also providing suboptimality bounds on the quality of the solution at any point in time. We also present an extension of this algorithm that is both anytime and incremental. This extension improves its current solution while deliberation time allows and is able to incrementally repair its solution when changes to the world model occur. We provide a number of theoretical and experimental results and demonstrate the effectiveness of the approaches in a robot navigation domain involving two physical systems. We believe that the simplicity, theoretical properties, and generality of the presented methods make them well suited to a range of search problems involving dynamic graphs. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Many path generation techniques focus on generation of time- or distance-optimal paths while obeying dynamic constraints, and often assume precise knowledge of robot and/or environmental (i.e. terrain) properties. In uneven terrain, it is essential that the robot mobility over the terrain be explicitly considered in the planning process. Further, since significant uncertainty is often associated with robot and/or terrain parameter knowledge, this should also be accounted for in a path generation algorithm. Here, extensions to the rapidly exploring random tree (RRT) algorithm are presented that explicitly consider robot mobility and robot parameter uncertainty based on the stochastic response surface method (SRSM). Simulation results suggest that the proposed approach can be used for generating safe paths on uncertain, uneven terrain.},

Due to the imperfect knowledge of the system state caused by motion uncertainty and sensor noise, the constraints cannot be guaranteed to be satisfied and consequently must be considered probabilistically. In this work, they are formulated as convex constraints on a univariate Gaussian random variable, with the violation probability of all the constraints guaranteed to be below a threshold. This threshold is a tuning parameter which trades off the performance of the system and the conservativeness of the solution. In contrast to similar methods, the proposed work considers the specific estimator and controller used in the closed-loop system in order to directly characterize the a priori distribution of the closed-loop system state. Using this distribution, a convex optimization program is formulated to solve for the optimal solution for the closed-loop system.

The key idea of our approach is to evaluate uncertainty, represented by collision probability bounds, at multiple resolutions in different regions of the configuration space, depending on their relevance for finding a best path. Preliminary experimental results show that our approach is highly effective: our BURM algorithm is at least 40 times faster than an algorithm that tries to evaluate collision probabilities exactly, and it is not much slower than classic probabilistic roadmap planning algorithms, which ignore uncertainty in environment maps.},

Our approach extends RRT*, which was introduced for holonomic robots [10], by using a fixed-final-state-free-final-time controller that optimally connects any pair of states, where the cost function is expressed as a trade-off between the duration of a trajectory and the expended control effort. Our approach generalizes earlier work on RRT* for kinodynamic systems, as it guarantees asymptotic optimality for any system with controllable linear dynamics, in state spaces of any dimension. In addition, we show that for the rich subclass of systems with a nilpotent dynamics matrix, closed-form solutions for optimal trajectories can be derived, which keeps the computational overhead of our algorithm compared to traditional RRT* at a minimum. We demonstrate the potential of our approach by computing asymptotically optimal trajectories in three challenging motion planning scenarios: (i) a planar robot with a 4-D state space and double integrator dynamics, (ii) an aerial vehicle with a 10-D state space and linearized quadrotor dynamics, and (iii) a car-like robot with a 5-D state space and non-linear dynamics.},

Estimating the probability of collision is an integral step in many algorithms for motion planning under uncertainty and is crucial for characterizing the safety of motion plans. Our method is computationally fast, enabling its use in online motion planning, and provides conservative estimates to promote safety. To improve accuracy, we use a novel method to truncate estimated a priori state distributions to account for the fact that the probability of collision at each stage along a plan is conditioned on the previous stages being collision free. Our method can be directly applied within a variety of existing motion planners to improve their performance and the quality of computed plans. We apply our method to a car-like mobile robot with second order dynamics and to a steerable medical needle in 3D and demonstrate that our method for estimating the probability of collision is orders of magnitude faster than naïve Monte Carlo sampling methods and reduces estimation error by more than 25{\%} compared to prior methods.},

From a practical point of view, FIRM is a robust and reliable planning framework. It is robust since the solution is a feedback and there is no need for expensive replanning. It is reliable because accurate collision probabilities can be computed along the edges. In addition, FIRM is a scalable framework, where the complexity of planning with FIRM is a constant multiplier of the complexity of planning with PRM. In this paper, FIRM is introduced as an abstract framework. As a concrete instantiation of FIRM, we adopt stationary linear quadratic Gaussian (SLQG) controllers as belief stabilizers and introduce the so-called SLQG-FIRM.

abstract = {For a 3-D underwater workspace with a variable ocean current, an integrated multiple autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) dynamic task assignment and path planning algorithm is proposed by combing the improved self-organizing map (SOM) neural network and a novel velocity synthesis approach. The goal is to control a team of AUVs to reach all appointed target locations for only one time on the premise of workload balance and energy sufficiency while guaranteeing the least total and individual consumption in the presence of the variable ocean current. First, the SOM neuron network is developed to assign a team of AUVs to achieve multiple target locations in 3-D ocean environment. The working process involves special definition of the initial neural weights of the SOM network, the rule to select the winner, the computation of the neighborhood function, and the method to update weights. Then, the velocity synthesis approach is applied to plan the shortest path for each AUV to visit the corresponding target in a dynamic environment subject to the ocean current being variable and targets being movable. Lastly, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, simulation results are given in this paper.},

Graph searching techniques were employed by Carroll et al. [6] for AUV path planning. In this case, a chart or graph is pro- duced showing free space where no collision will occur and forbidden spaces where a collision will occur. Based on this graph, a path is selected by piecing together the free spaces or by tracing around the forbidden spaces.

The authors also note significant computation times for A* path planning (order 10-100s CPU time with currents sampled only once every nautical mile).

The algorithm satisfies the upper bounded curvature constraint and the continuous curvature requirement. In this work greater attention is placed on the computational complexity in comparison with other path-planning considerations. The rapidly-exploring random trees (RRTs) algorithm is used for the generation of collision free waypoints. The unnecessary waypoints are removed by a simple path pruning algorithm generating a piecewise linear path. Then a path smoothing algorithm utilizing cubic Bezier spiral curves to generate a continuous curvature path that satisfies the minimum radius of curvature constraint of UAV is implemented. The angle between two waypoints is the only information required for the generation of the continuous curvature path. The result shows that the suggested algorithm is simple and easy to implement compared with the Clothoids method.},

In particular, techniques based on the Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRTs) have generated highly successful single-query planners. Even though RRTs work well on many problems, they have weaknesses which cause them to explore slowly when the sampling domain is not well adapted to the problem. In this paper we characterize these issues and propose a general framework for minimizing their effect. We develop and implement a simple new planner which shows significant improvement over existing RRT-based planners. In the worst cases, the performance appears to be only slightly worse in comparison to the original RRT, and for many problems it performs orders of magnitude better.},

This is the problem of planning a path through a continuous domain Rapidly-exploring random trees (RRTs) are a recently developed representation on which fast continuous domain path planners can be based. In this work, we build a path planning system based on RRTs that interleaves planning and execution, first evaluating it in simulation and then applying it to physical robots. Our planning algorithm, ERRT (execution extended RRT), introduces two novel extensions of previous RRT work, the waypoint cache and adaptive cost penalty search, which improve replanning efficiency and the quality of generated paths. ERRT is successfully applied to a real-time multi-robot system. Results demonstrate that ERRT is significantly more efficient for replanning than a basic RRT planner, performing competitively with or better than existing heuristic and reactive real-time path planning approaches. ERRT is a significant step forward with the potential for making path planning common on real robots, even in challenging continuous, highly dynamic domains.},

abstract = {This study evaluated the use of video transects obtained from SCUBA divers or remote operated vehicle (ROV) and point intercept transect (PIT) method from divers for monitoring subtropical coral communities. Comparisons were made between the datasets obtained by the ROV and SCUBA diver video transect ('Diver') and the PIT method on three nearby coral sites with different hydrographies, scleractinian coral composition, dominant species and percentage cover. There was no significant difference between the ROV and 'Diver' datasets whereas the PIT method tended to over-estimate percentage cover at sites where corals are not extensive. Power analysis showed that the minimum detectable change in coral percentage cover, ??, had low mean values between 0.39{\%} and 1.65{\%} for the ROV dataset, 0.66{\%} for the "Diver' dataset, and 12.11{\%} for the PIT dataset. This implied that the ROV and SCUBA survey methods can produce higher precision in terms of detecting temporal changes in coral communities and are thus more suitable for scientific research and management purposes than the PIT method. Other advantages of using video transects by SCUBA divers or ROV include provision of permanent records for subsequent studies and public information, less field time incurred and wider survey areas. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

This path planning algorithm incorporates the effects of vehicle mass point dynamics, body dynamic behavior, sensor vision zone, thruster characters and all environments. Software for the algorithm was developed to produce numerical solutions of path planning for the URV in different unknown environments. These numerical results of path planning include terrain following and terrain avoidance, avoiding static obstacles, passing some target points, and synthetic trajectory considering complex mazes.

Our approach is designed for non-linear dynamics and obser- vation models, and follows the general POMDP solution framework in which we represent beliefs by Gaussian distributions, approximate the belief dynamics using an extended Kalman filter (EKF), and represent the value function by a quadratic function that is valid in the vicinity of a nominal trajectory through belief space. Using a variant of differential dynamic programming, our approach iterates with second-order convergence towards a linear control policy over the belief space that is locally-optimal with respect to a user-defined cost function. Unlike previouswork, our approach does not assume maximum-likelihood observations, does not assume fixed estimator or control gains, takes into account obstacles in the environment, and does not require discretization of the belief space. The running time of the algorithm is polynomial in the dimension of the state space. We demonstrate the potential of our approach in several continuous partially-observable planning domains with ob- stacles for robots with non-linear dynamics and observation models.},

abstract = {This paper considers the real-time motion planning problem for autonomous systems subject to complex dynamics, constraints, and uncertainty. Rapidly-exploring random trees (RRT) can be used to efficiently construct trees of dynamically feasible trajectories; however, to ensure feasibility, it is critical that the system actually track its predicted trajectory. This paper shows that under certain assumptions, the recently proposed closed-loop RRT (CL-RRT) algorithm can be used to accurately track a trajectory with known error bounds and robust feasibility guarantees, without the need for replanning. Unlike open-loop approaches, bounds can be designed on the maximum prediction error for a known uncertainty distribution. Using the property that a stabilized linear system subject to bounded process noise has BIBO-stable error dynamics, this paper shows how to modify the problem constraints to ensure long-term feasibility under uncertainty. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the closed-loop RRT approach compared to open-loop alternatives.},

abstract = {It is anticipatedthat theMars ScienceLaboratory rover, namedCuriosity,will traverse 10–20 kmon the surface of Mars during its primary mission. In preparation for this traverse, Earth-based tests were performed using Mars weight vehicles. These vehicles were driven over Mars analog bedrock, cohesive soil, and cohesionless sand at various slopes. Vehicle slip was characterized on each of these terrains versus slope for direct upslope driving. Results show that slopes up to 22 degrees are traversable on smooth bedrock and that slopes up to 28 degrees are traversable on some cohesive soils. In cohesionless sand, results show a sharp transition between moderate slip on 10 degree slopes and vehicle embedding at 17 degrees. For cohesionless sand, data are also presented showing the relationship between vehicle slip and wheel sinkage. Side by side testing of the Mars Exploration Rover test vehicle and the Mars Science Laboratory test vehicle show how increased wheel diameter leads to better slope climbing ability in sand for vehicles with nearly identical ground pressure. Lastly, preliminary data from Curiosity's initial driving on Mars are presented and compared to the Earth-based testing, showing good agreement for the driving done during the first 250 Martian days.},

abstract = {—Intelligent vehicles have increased their capabilities for highly and, even fully, automated driving under controlled environments. Scene information is received using onboard sen-sors and communication network systems, i.e., infrastructure and other vehicles. Considering the available information, different motion planning and control techniques have been implemented to autonomously driving on complex environments. The main goal is focused on executing strategies to improve safety, comfort, and energy optimization. However, research challenges such as navi-gation in urban dynamic environments with obstacle avoidance capabilities, i.e., vulnerable road users (VRU) and vehicles, and cooperative maneuvers among automated and semi-automated vehicles still need further efforts for a real environment implemen-tation. This paper presents a review of motion planning techniques implemented in the intelligent vehicles literature. A description of the technique used by research teams, their contributions in motion planning, and a comparison among these techniques is also presented. Relevant works in the overtaking and obstacle avoidance maneuvers are presented, allowing the understanding of the gaps and challenges to be addressed in the next years. Finally, an overview of future research direction and applications is given.},

Available models provide accurate prediction of ocean currents, but they typically do not provide confidence estimates of these predictions. We propose augmenting existing prediction methods with variance measures based on Gaussian Process (GP) regression. We show that commonly used measures of variance in GPs do not accurately reflect errors in ocean current prediction, and we propose an alternative uncertainty measure based on interpolation variance. We integrate these measures of uncertainty into a probabilistic planner running on an AUV during a field deployment in the Southern California Bight. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed uncertainty measures improve the safety and reliability of AUVs operating in the coastal ocean},

Since the disturbance is unbounded, it is impossible to achieve zero probability of violating constraints. Our goal is to optimize the expected value of an objective function while limiting the probability of violating any constraints over the planning horizon (joint chance constraint). Prior arts include ellipsoidal relaxation approach [1] and particle control [2], but the former yields very conservative result and the latter is computationally intensive. Our approach divide the optimization problem into two stages; the upper-stage that optimizes risk allocation, and the lower-stage that optimizes control sequence with tightened constraints. The lower-stage is a regular convex optimization, such as linear programming or quadratic programming. The upper-stage is also convex, but the objective function is not always differentiable. We developed a fast descent algorithm for the upper-stage called iterative risk allocation (IRA), which yield much smaller suboptimality than ellipsoidal relaxation method while achieving a substantial speedup compared to and particle control.},

Namely, the solution extracted from LBT-RRT converges to a solution that is within an approximation factor of 1+epsilon of the optimal solution. Our algorithm allows for a continuous interpolation between the fast RRT algorithm and the asymptotically optimal RRT* and RRG algorithms. When the approximation factor is 1 (i.e., no approximation is allowed), LBT-RRT behaves like the RRT* algorithm. When the approximation factor is unbounded, LBT-RRT behaves like the RRT algorithm. In between, LBT-RRT is shown to produce paths that have higher quality than RRT would produce and run faster than RRT* would run. and a second, auxiliary tree, which we call the lower-bound tree. The combination of the two trees, which is faster to maintain than the tree maintained by RRT*, efficiently guarantee asymptotic near-optimality. We suggest to use LBT-RRT for high-quality, anytime motion planning. We demonstrate the performance of the algorithm for scenarios ranging from 3 to 12 degrees of freedom and show that even for small approximation factors, the algorithm produces high-quality solutions (comparable to RRT*) with little runtime overhead when compared to RRT.},

Start-to-goal task under currents

In [Kruger 2006]
More recent work (Garau et al., [8]) is restricted to considerations of motion on a 2D plane. The plane is divided into a coarse grid of equi-spaced nodes, which are connected by edges to form a graph. Each edge is assigned a cost according to estimated journey time, assuming constant motor speed, and the minimum cost route is found with an A* search. This approach has a number of drawbacks for estuarine navigation. Firstly, since only 2D motion is addressed, the technique is unable to plan paths which dive or climb to avoid adverse current layers or to exploit useful current layers. This ability is crucial to successful navigation in a tidal estuary where two stratified layers of water are often traveling in opposite directions at high speeds. Secondly, the technique is unable to plan for variable AUV power output. Thus an AUV is unable to fully exploit the currents for certain applications where drifting with useful currents at minimal motor speeds is essential for prolonging mission lifetimes. Thirdly, although the authors consider spatially varying current fields, the problem of current velocities which vary with time is not addressed. In contrast, in our estuarine application, currents vary substantially over relatively short timescales, often reversing direction over tidal cycles. The ability to handle temporal current variation is important. Fourthly, Garau et al. note a substantial computation time of around 35 seconds to plan paths of order lkm length, presumably using a dedicated offline CPU. If the method were to be extended to the necessary 3D motion space, this time would increase significantly, even more so if only part of the CPU time of an onboard AUV controller could be assigned to the task. This makes the method inappropriate for enabling an AUV to regularly re-plan the remainder of its path in response to updated current or obstacle data during the mission. Carroll

abstract = {During the last decade, sampling-based path planning algorithms, such as Probabilistic RoadMaps (PRM) and Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT), have been shown to work well in practice and possess theoretical guarantees such as probabilistic completeness. However, little effort has been devoted to the formal analysis of the quality of the solution returned by such algorithms, e.g., as a function of the number of samples. The purpose of this paper is to fill this gap, by rigorously analyzing the asymptotic behavior of the cost of the solution returned by stochastic sampling-based algorithms as the number of samples increases. A number of negative results are provided, characterizing existing algorithms, e.g., showing that, under mild technical conditions, the cost of the solution returned by broadly used sampling-based algorithms converges almost surely to a non-optimal value. The main contribution of the paper is the introduction of new algorithms, namely, PRM* and RRT*, which are provably asymptotically optimal, i.e., such that the cost of the returned solution converges almost surely to the optimum. Moreover, it is shown that the computational complexity of the new algorithms is within a constant factor of that of their probabilistically complete (but not asymptotically optimal) counterparts. The analysis in this paper hinges on novel connections between stochastic sampling-based path planning algorithms and the theory of random geometric graphs.},

Our approach represents beliefs (the distributions of the robot's state estimate) by Gaussian distributions and is applicable to robot systems with non-linear dynamics and observation models. The method follows the general POMDP solution framework in which we approximate the belief dynamics using an extended Kalman filter and represent the value function by a quadratic function that is valid in the vicinity of a nominal trajectory through belief space. Using a belief space variant of iterative LQG (iLQG), our approach iterates with second-order convergence towards a linear control policy over the belief space that is locally optimal with respect to a user-defined cost function. Unlike previous work, our approach does not assume maximum-likelihood observations, does not assume fixed estimator or control gains, takes into account obstacles in the environment, and does not require discretization of the state and action spaces. The running time of the algorithm is polynomial (O[n6]) in the dimension n of the state space. We demonstrate the potential of our approach in simulation for holonomic and non-holonomic robots maneuvering through environments with obstacles with noisy and partial sensing and with non-linear dynamics and observation models.},

To give the robot the ability of acting and navigating in complex environments, the motion planner has to find collision-free paths in a robust manner. The runtime of a planning algorithm is critical, since complex tasks require several planning steps where the collision detection and avoidance should be accomplished in reasonable time. In this paper we present an extension of standard sampling-based techniques using Rapidly Exploring Random Trees (RRT). We extend the free-bubble path validation algorithm from Quinlan, which can be used to guarantee the collision-free status of a C-space path between two samples. By using enlarged robot models it is possible to avoid costly distance calculations and therefore to speed up the planning process. We also present a combined approach based on lazy collision checking that brings together the advantages of fast sampling-based and exact path-validated algorithms. The proposed algorithms have been evaluated by experiments on a humanoid robot in a kitchen environment and by a comparison to a validation based on Quinlan's free bubbles approach.},

In this paper, we show that planning in belief space can be done efficiently for linearGaussian systems by using a factored form of the covariance matrix. This factored form allows several prediction and measurement steps to be combined into a single linear transfer function, leading to very efficient posterior belief prediction during planning.We give a belief-space variant of the Probabilistic Roadmap algorithm called the Belief Roadmap (BRM) and show that the BRM can compute plans substantially faster than conventional belief space planning. We conclude with performance results for an agent using ultra-wide bandwidth (UWB) radio beacons to localize and show that we can efficiently generate plans that avoid failures due to loss of accurate position estimation},

The approach is based on deterministic search in a specially discretized state space. We compute a set of elementary motions that connects each discrete state value to a set of its reachable neighbors via feasible motions. Thus, this set of motions induces a connected search graph. The motions are carefully designed to terminate at discrete states, whose dimensions include relevant state variables (e.g., posi- tion, heading, curvature, and velocity). The discrete states, and thus the motions, repeat at regular intervals, forming a lattice. We ensure that all paths in the graph encode feasible motions via the imposition of continuity constraints on state variables at graph vertices and compliance of the graph edges with a differential equation comprising the vehicle model. The resulting state lattice permits fast full configuration space cost evaluation and collision detection. Experimental results with research prototype rovers demonstrate that the planner allows us to exploit the entire envelope of vehicle maneuverability in rough terrain, while featuring real-time performance.},

abstract = {Autonomous mobile robots have been widely studied and applied not only as a test bed to academically demonstrate the achievement of artificial intelligence but also as an essential component of industrial and home automation. Mobile robots have many potential applications in routine or dangerous tasks such as delivery of supplies in hospitals, cleaning of offices, and operations in a nuclear plant. One of the fundamental and critical research areas in mobile robotics is navigation, which generally includes local navigation and global navigation. Local navigation, often called reactive control, learns or plans the local paths using the current sensory inputs without prior complete knowledge of the environment. Global navigation, often called deliberate control, learns or plans the global paths based on a relatively abstract and complete knowledge about the environment. In this article, hybrid control architecture is conceived via combining reactive and deliberate control using a hierarchical Q-learning (HQL) algorithm.},

We seek hypotheses that can justify a separate implementation of control, localization and planning. In the end, we reduce the stochastic control problem to path-planning in the extended space of poses x covariances; the transitions between states are modeled through the use of the Fisher information matrix. In this framework, we consider two problems: minimizing the execution time, and minimizing the final covariance, with an upper bound on the execution time. Two correct and complete algorithms are presented. The first is the direct extension of classical graph-search algorithms in the extended space. The second one is a back-projection algorithm: uncertainty constraints are propagated backward from the goal towards the start state.},

However, they need a complete and accurate model of the environment and such an assumption may cause a collision in executing the results in a real world with its uncertainties. Considering uncertainties in the model of environment, we reformulate the path planning problem in a stochastic map and then propose a way to modify classical path planning methods in order to fit into this new framework. Our work shares ideas with previous work in this area but follows a different approach. In this framework, sensors and landmarks need to be taken into account. The core computations lie in the evaluation of the probability of collision of configurations with the map.},

Importantly, our results do not depend strongly on local irregularities of the configuration space, as was the case with previous analysis.

abstract = {This paper presents a method for robot motion planning in dynamic environments. It consists of selecting avoidance maneuvers to avoid static and moving obstacles in the velocity space, based on the cur rent positions and velocities of the robot and obstacles. It is a first- order method, since it does not integrate velocities to yield positions as functions of time. The avoidance maneuvers are generated by selecting robot ve locities outside of the velocity obstacles, which represent the set of robot velocities that would result in a collision with a given obstacle that moves at a given velocity, at some future time. To ensure that the avoidance maneuver is dynamically feasible, the set of avoidance velocities is intersected with the set of admissible velocities, defined by the robot's acceleration constraints. Computing new avoidance maneuvers at regular time intervals accounts for general obstacle trajectories. The trajectory from start to goal is computed by searching a tree of feasible avoidance maneuvers, computed at discrete time intervals. An exhaustive search of the tree yields near-optimal trajectories that either minimize distance or motion time. A heuristic search of the tree is applicable to on-line planning. The method is demonstrated for point and disk robots among static and moving obstacles, and for an automated vehicle in an intelligent vehicle highway system scenario.},

It will be referred to in this paper as the Robot Navigation-Hierarchical POMDP (RN-HPOMDP). The RN-HPOMDP is utilized as a unified framework for autonomous robot navigation in dynamic environments. As such, it is used for localization, planning and local obstacle avoidance. Hence, the RN-HPOMDP decides at each time step the actions the robot should execute, without the intervention of any other external module for obstacle avoidance or localization. Our approach employs state space and action space hierarchy, and can effectively model large environments at a fine resolution. Finally, the notion of the reference POMDP is introduced. The latter holds all the information regarding motion and sensor uncertainty, which makes the proposed hierarchical structure memory efficient and enables fast learning. The RN-HPOMDP has been experimentally validated in real dynamic environments. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The approach consists of a preprocessing and a planning stage. Preprocessing, which is done only once for a given environment, generates a network of randomly, but properly selected, collision-free configurations (nodes). Planning then connects any given initial and final configurations of the robot to two nodes of the network and computes a path through the network between these two nodes. Experiments show that after paying the preprocessing cost (on the order of hundreds of seconds), planning is extremely fast (on the order of a fraction of a second for many difficult examples involving a 10-DOF robot). The approach is particularly attractive for many-DOF robots which have to perform many successive point-to-point motions in the same environment},

During this expedition, investigators used underwater robot systems ca- pable of mapping ancient underwater cisterns and tunnels. The mapping included probabilistic algorithms for constructing the maps of the sonar data and computer graphics for surface reconstruction and visualization. This paper presents the general methodology for the data acquisition and the novel application of algorithms from computer graphics for surface reconstruction to this new data setting. In addition to reconstructing the geometry of the cisterns, the visualization system includes methods to enhance the understanding of the data by visualizing water level and texture detail either through the application of real image data via pro- jective textures or by more standard texture mapping techniques. The resulting surface reconstructions and visualizations can be used by ar- chaeologists for educational purposes and to help understand the shape and history of such water receptacles.},

@article{Janson2013,
abstract = {In this paper we present a novel probabilistic sampling-based motion planning algorithm called the Fast Marching Tree algorithm (FMT*). The algorithm is specifically aimed at solving complex motion planning problems in high-dimensional configuration spaces. This algorithm is proven to be asymptotically optimal and is shown to converge to an optimal solution faster than its state-of-the-art counterparts, chiefly, PRM* and RRT*. An additional advantage of FMT* is that it builds and maintains paths in a tree-like structure (especially useful for planning under differential constraints). The FMT* algorithm essentially performs a "lazy" dynamic programming recursion on a set of probabilistically-drawn samples to grow a tree of paths, which moves steadily outward in cost-to-come space. As such, this algorithm combines features of both single-query algorithms (chiefly RRT) and multiple-query algorithms (chiefly PRM), and is conceptually related to the Fast Marching Method for the solution of eikonal equations. As a departure from previous analysis approaches that are based on the notion of almost sure convergence, the FMT* algorithm is analyzed under the notion of convergence in probability: the extra mathematical flexibility of this approach allows for significant algorithmic advantages and is of independent interest. Numerical experiments over a range of dimensions and obstacle configurations confirm our theoretical and heuristic arguments by showing that FMT returns substantially better solutions than either PRM* or RRT*.},

abstract = {research project applying artificial intelligence techniques to the development of integrated robot systems is described. The experimental facili ty consists of an SDS-940 computer and associated programs controlling a wheeled vehicle that carries a TV camera and other sensors. The primary emphasis is on the development of a system of programs for processing sensory data from the vehicle, for storing relevant information about the environment, and for planning the sequence of motor actions necessary to accomplish tasks in the environment. A typical task performed by our present system requires the robot vehicle to rearrange (by pushing) simple objects in its environment. A novel feature of our approach is the use of a formal theorem-proving system to plan the execution of high-level functions as a sequence of other, perhaps lower level, functions. The execution of these in turn requires additional planning at lower levels. The main theme of the research is the integration of the necessary planning systems, models of the world and sensory processing systems into an efficient whole capable of perf orming a wide range of tasks in a real environment.},

abstract = {It is anticipatedthat theMars ScienceLaboratory rover, namedCuriosity,will traverse 10–20 kmon the surface of Mars during its primary mission. In preparation for this traverse, Earth-based tests were performed using Mars weight vehicles. These vehicles were driven over Mars analog bedrock, cohesive soil, and cohesionless sand at various slopes. Vehicle slip was characterized on each of these terrains versus slope for direct upslope driving. Results show that slopes up to 22 degrees are traversable on smooth bedrock and that slopes up to 28 degrees are traversable on some cohesive soils. In cohesionless sand, results show a sharp transition between moderate slip on 10 degree slopes and vehicle embedding at 17 degrees. For cohesionless sand, data are also presented showing the relationship between vehicle slip and wheel sinkage. Side by side testing of the Mars Exploration Rover test vehicle and the Mars Science Laboratory test vehicle show how increased wheel diameter leads to better slope climbing ability in sand for vehicles with nearly identical ground pressure. Lastly, preliminary data from Curiosity's initial driving on Mars are presented and compared to the Earth-based testing, showing good agreement for the driving done during the first 250 Martian days.},

abstract = {The context of this work is the exploration of unknown polygonal environments with obstacles. Both the outer boundary and the boundaries of obstacles are piecewise linear. The boundaries can be nonconvex. The exploration problem can be motivated by the following application. Imagine that a robot has to explore the interior of a collapsed building, which has crumbled due to an earthquake, to search for human survivors. It is clearly impossible to have a knowledge of the building's interior geometry prior to the exploration. Thus, the robot must be able to see, with its onboard vision sensors, all points in the building's interior while following its exploration path. In this way, no potential survivors will be missed by the exploring robot. The exploratory path must clearly reflect the topology of the free space, and, therefore, such exploratory paths can be used to guide future robot excursions (such as would arise in our example from a rescue operation).},

Note that this is a brief tutorial rather than a comprehensive survey of methods. For the lat ter, consult some of the recent textbooks. Motion planning involves getting a robot to automatically determine how to move while avoiding collisions with obstacles. Its original formulation, called the piano mov er's problem, is imagined as determining how to move a complicated piece of furniture through a cluttered house. Have you ever argued about how to move a sofa up a stairwell? It has been clear for several decades that getting robots to reason geometrically about their environments and synthesize such plans is a fundamental difficulty that recurs all over robotics.},
